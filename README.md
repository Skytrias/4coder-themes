Hey skytrias here, this repo will store my custom made 4coder themes.

Sometimes I disable things that you should optionally try to enable to see if you like them.

Simply put these theme-*.4coder files into your 4coder/themes folder, then in your 4coder/config.4coder you have to specify the "default_theme_name" to the name of the theme, which you will find inside of the file itself. I'll try to keep it like the filename itself.

Example1 in 4coder/config.4coder:
default_theme_name = "nord";

Example2 in 4coder/config.4coder:
default_theme_name = "solarized-dark";
